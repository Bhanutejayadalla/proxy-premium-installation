## 🔵 Mesh Network — Deep Dive

### What is it?
The Mesh Chat system lets two or more Proxi devices communicate **entirely without mobile data** using Bluetooth Low Energy (for peer discovery) and **Wi-Fi Direct** (for data transfer). The implementation uses Android's native `WifiP2pManager` API — no third-party networking library is involved.

---

### Architecture: BLE Discovery → Wi-Fi Direct → TCP Sockets

### Message Packet Format (`MeshWirePacket`)

Every message is serialized to newline-delimited JSON over the TCP socket:

```json
{
  "mid": "uuid-v4",
  "sid": "firebase_uid_of_sender",
  "rid": "firebase_uid_of_recipient",
  "pay": "<iv_base64>.<ciphertext_base64>",
  "ts":  1741420800000,
  "hop": 0
}
```

- `pay` is the AES-256-CBC ciphertext of the original message text
- `hop` increments by 1 at each relay node; packets are dropped when `hop ≥ 5`
- A handshake JSON (`type:"handshake", uid:…`) is exchanged first to map Wi-Fi Direct MAC addresses to Firebase UIDs

---

### Encryption Layer (`MeshEncryptionService`)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Algorithm** | AES-256-CBC |
| **Key derivation** | Real SHA-256 (`package:crypto`) of `sorted(senderUid + receiverUid) + ":proxi-mesh-v1"` |
| **IV** | 16 cryptographically random bytes per message, prepended as `<iv_b64>.<cipher_b64>` |
| **Library** | `encrypt: 5.0.3` + `crypto: 3.0.3` |
| **Cloud storage** | Only `encrypted_payload` is synced to Firestore — plaintext is never uploaded |

**Encrypt flow:**
```
plaintext ──► AES-256-CBC(key=SHA256(sortedUids+salt), iv=random16) ──► "<iv_b64>.<cipher_b64>"
```

**Decrypt flow:**
```
"<iv_b64>.<cipher_b64>" ──► split ──► AES-256-CBC-decrypt(key=SHA256(sortedUids+salt)) ──► plaintext
```

---

### Multi-Hop Relay Logic

When device A wants to reach device C but they are out of Wi-Fi Direct range, device B (in range of both) acts as a relay:

```
 A ──WiFi Direct──► B ──WiFi Direct──► C
                  (relay)
```

1. A sends packet to B (`hop = 0`)
2. B sees `receiverId ≠ myUid` — increments `hop` to 1, forwards to all peers except the sender
3. C decrypts and delivers the message; `hop ≥ 5` → packet dropped
4. If B cannot forward, it stores the relay-packet in SQLite and delivers when a new peer connects

**Deduplication:** A `Set<String>` + FIFO `Queue<String>` (capped at 500 entries) prevents each device from processing the same packet more than once.

---

### Local Persistence Layer (`MeshDbService` · SQLite)

**Database:** `mesh_messages.db`  
**Table:** `mesh_messages`

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `message_id` | TEXT PK | UUID v4, globally unique |
| `sender_id` | TEXT | Firebase UID of sender |
| `receiver_id` | TEXT | Firebase UID of recipient |
| `message_text` | TEXT | Decrypted plaintext (empty for relay-only records) |
| `timestamp` | INTEGER | Unix epoch milliseconds |
| `delivery_status` | TEXT | `pending` / `relayed` / `delivered` / `synced` |
| `hop_count` | INTEGER | How many relay nodes have forwarded this packet |
| `encrypted_payload` | TEXT | Wire-safe ciphertext (`<iv>.<cipher>`) |

**Indexes:**  
- `idx_conversation (sender_id, receiver_id)` — fast chatlog queries  
- `idx_status (delivery_status)` — fast pending/unsynced queries

---

### Cloud Sync Layer (`MeshSyncService`)

Handled by `connectivity_plus` watching network state changes:

```
Offline  ──► [messages stored in SQLite with status=pending/delivered] ──► Online
                                                                              │
                                              ┌───────────────────────────────┘
                                              ▼
                              _uploadUnsynced() — batch Firestore set()
                                    to mesh_messages/{messageId}
                                    (stores encrypted_payload only, never plaintext)
                              _downloadMissing() — query Firestore
                                    where receiver_id == myUid (limit 100)
```

**Firestore collection:** `mesh_messages/{messageId}`  
**Security rules:** Only sender can create; only sender or receiver can read; nobody can update/delete

### How to Test on Two Physical Devices

> **Wi-Fi Direct does NOT work on Android emulators. Two physical Android phones are required.**

1. Install the APK on **both** devices
2. Sign in with different accounts on each
3. Enable **Bluetooth**, **Wi-Fi**, and **Location** on both; place them within **1–2 metres** of each other
4. On Device A: open any chat → tap the **🔵 Bluetooth icon** to toggle Mesh ON
5. The status banner progresses: `Scanning… → BLE found N → WiFi connecting… → Connected (N socket)`
6. Do the same on Device B
7. Send a message — it arrives on Device B **instantly with no internet**
8. Delivery status: **🕐 Pending → ↔ Relayed → ✓ Delivered → ☁ Synced**
9. Check `logcat` for `[MeshService]` and `WifiDirectPlugin` tags to trace the pipeline

> **Tip:** Both devices must have Bluetooth ON, Wi-Fi ON, and Location permission granted. Multiple devices can connect simultaneously — Multi-peer is fully supported.
