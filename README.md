## � How to Connect Your Phone

This section covers two methods: **USB** (most reliable) and **Wireless** (Android 11+).

---

### Method 1 — USB Debugging (Recommended)

#### Step 1 — Enable Developer Mode on Your Android Phone

1. Open **Settings** on your phone
2. Scroll down → tap **About phone**
3. Find **Build number** (may be under *Software information*)
4. **Tap Build number 7 times** in quick succession
5. You'll see: *"You are now a developer!"*
6. Go back to **Settings** → scroll down → tap **Developer options**

#### Step 2 — Enable USB Debugging

1. Inside **Developer options**, find **USB debugging**
2. Toggle it **ON**
3. Tap **OK** on the confirmation popup

#### Step 3 — Connect via USB Cable

1. Plug your phone into your laptop using a **data-capable USB cable**  
   ⚠️ *Some cables are charge-only — if detection fails, try a different cable*
2. On your phone, a popup appears: **"Allow USB debugging?"**
3. Check **"Always allow from this computer"** then tap **Allow**
4. On your phone, when asked **"Use USB for"**, select **File Transfer (MTP)**

#### Step 4 — Verify Connection

```powershell
# In your project folder:
adb devices
```

You should see something like:
```
List of devices attached
RF8N20XXXXX   device
```

If it shows `unauthorized` — look at your phone for the debugging popup and tap Allow.

#### Step 5 — Run the App on Your Phone

```powershell
cd D:\Proxi_Social_Connectivity\mobile_app
flutter devices          # verify your phone appears
flutter run              # builds and installs app on phone
```

The first build takes **3-5 minutes**. Subsequent runs are ~15 seconds (hot reload).

---

### Method 2 — Wireless Debugging (Android 11+)

No USB cable required after initial setup.

#### On Your Phone
1. Go to **Settings** → **Developer options** → **Wireless debugging**
2. Toggle **Wireless debugging ON**
3. Tap **Pair device with pairing code**
4. Note the **IP address:port** and **pairing code** shown

#### On Your Laptop (same Wi-Fi network)

```powershell
# Step 1: Pair once using the code from your phone screen
adb pair <IP_ADDRESS>:<PAIRING_PORT>
# Enter the 6-digit pairing code when prompted

# Step 2: Connect (use the main port, not the pairing port)
adb connect <IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>

# Step 3: Verify
adb devices

# Step 4: Run app
cd mobile_app
flutter run
```

**Example:**
```powershell
adb pair 192.168.1.5:37549   # pairing code: 123456
adb connect 192.168.1.5:40123
```

---

### Troubleshooting Connection Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `No devices found` | Check USB cable (use data cable, not charge-only) |
| `unauthorized` | Accept the USB debugging popup on your phone |
| Device shows then disappears | Disable battery optimization for ADB |
| `adb: command not found` | Add Android SDK `platform-tools` to your PATH |
| Wireless debugging not visible | Requires Android 11 or higher |
| App installs but crashes | Run `flutter clean` then `flutter run` again |
| `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE` | Uninstall old version from phone first |

```powershell
# Quick fix: reset ADB connection
adb kill-server
adb start-server
adb devices
```

## 🤝 How to Send & Accept Connections

Connections are a **Formal (Pro) mode** feature — professional networking between users you discover nearby.

---

### Step 1 — Switch to Pro Mode

Tap the **PRO / SOCIAL** chip in the top header of the app to switch to **PRO** mode.  
Connections are mode-specific: Pro connections = professional network, Social connections = casual network.

---

### Step 2 — Discover a Nearby User

1. Go to the **Nearby** tab (radar icon in the bottom nav)
2. Tap **Scan** to start BLE or GPS discovery
3. Nearby users appear as cards on screen

---

### Step 3 — Send a Connection Request

1. On a nearby user's card, tap **Connect**
2. A confirmation snackbar appears: *"Connection request sent!"*
3. The request is stored in Firestore with status `pending`

> You can also send a request from a user's **profile page** — tap their avatar in the Nearby list to open their profile, then tap **Connect**.

---

### Step 4 — Accepting a Connection Request (Recipient)

When someone sends you a request, you have **two ways** to accept it:

#### Option A — via Notifications (Bell Icon)
1. Tap the 🔔 **bell icon** in the top-right header
2. You'll see a notification: **"[Username] sent you a connection request"**
3. Tapping the notification takes you to the **Connection Requests** screen

#### Option B — via Settings
1. Go to the **Profile** tab (last tab in the bottom nav)
2. Tap the **⚙ Settings** gear icon (top-right of profile screen)
3. Scroll down to **"Connection Requests"**
4. Tap it to open the full requests list

#### On the Connection Requests screen:
| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| Requester's name, avatar, and headline | Review who is requesting |
| Mode label (Pro / Social) | Know which mode the request is for |
| Optional message from requester | Read their note (if they added one) |
| **Accept** button | Tap to accept — you're now connected |
| **Decline** button | Tap to decline — request is removed |

After accepting, a *"Connection accepted"* confirmation appears at the bottom of the screen.

---

### Step 5 — Viewing Your Connections

Your accepted connections are visible in **Settings → Connection Requests** (shows pending only) and will be used for feed filtering and profile visibility in future updates.

---

### Connection Privacy

You can control who sees your profile in **Settings → Privacy**:

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Public** | Anyone can view your profile |
| **Connections Only** | Only accepted connections see your full profile |

---

## 📶 Offline Features

A breakdown of exactly what works with and without an internet connection.

---

### ✅ Works Without Internet

These features run entirely on-device with no server calls:

| Feature | How it works offline |
|---|---|
| **Mode Toggle** (Formal ↔ Casual) | State stored in memory — switches instantly with no network calls |
| **BLE Scanning (Bluetooth radar)** | Bluetooth hardware scans for nearby devices — the radar animation and device detection work fully offline |
| **Browse already-loaded feed** | Posts loaded in the current session stay in Provider state — you can scroll through them without reconnecting |
| **Browse already-loaded stories** | Same as feed — stories visible in current session remain accessible |
| **Cached profile info** | Your own profile data (name, avatar, bio) loaded at login is available throughout the session |
| **Compose a post (draft)** | You can type text and pick a photo — the Share button will fail without internet, but drafting works |

---

### ❌ Requires Internet

These features make Firestore / Firebase / Cloudinary calls and will fail or show empty data without a connection:

| Feature | Why it needs internet |
|---|---|
| **Login / Sign-Up** | Firebase Auth requires a server call to verify identity |
| **Loading the Feed** | Posts are fetched via Firestore real-time stream |
| **Loading Stories** | Stories fetched from Firestore with 24h expiry check |
| **Loading Reels** | Reel video metadata + URLs fetched from Firestore |
| **Liking / Commenting** | Writes to Firestore `posts` or `reels` collection |
| **Publishing a Post/Story/Reel** | Image uploaded to Cloudinary, metadata written to Firestore |
| **Chat (send/receive)** | Firestore stream subscription for real-time messages |
| **Push Notifications** | Firebase Cloud Messaging requires internet |
| **GPS Nearby Discovery** | Device location is obtained offline, but user matching queries Firestore |
| **BLE Nearby — Show Profiles** | BLE finds devices locally, but profile data (name, avatar) is fetched from Firestore |
| **Job Board** | Jobs loaded from Firestore |
| **Connection Requests** | Written to Firestore |
| **Profile Updates** | Written to Firestore + avatar uploaded to Cloudinary |

---

### 💡 Tips for Low Connectivity

- **Open the app on Wi-Fi first** — data loads into Provider state and stays available during the session even if you step into a weak signal area
- **BLE proximity works best offline** — if you just need to find who is physically near you, Bluetooth scanning works with airplane mode + Bluetooth enabled
- **Drafts**: You can compose post text and pick images while offline; tap Share once you regain connectivity
